As an Admin, I want to download a user report as an Excel file.

The user report should include the following columns:
- UserId,
- Email
- Full Name
- User Tier (Noob, Awesome etc...)
- Total login count
- Date Registered
- Last Login Date

Login statistics should be implemented using the Event Sourcing Pattern
